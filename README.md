This is a Express API as a beginner project.

Description: I created a basic website that displays weather information that has been fetched from OpenWeatherMap API and stores the caches the weather in this secondary API that I made. This is the API end of the project.  It is meant to be used in tandem with the nology-project4-weatherApp-frontend repository: https://github.com/BrandonThey/nology-project4-weatherApp-frontend.git.
This project was to practice and implement new skills in Javascript, which was done through the use of sending from the API.

How to install and run the project:

1. Fork both this repository and the frontend repository found here: https://github.com/BrandonThey/nology-project4-weatherApp-frontend.git.
2. Clone both forked repositories
3. Open up the backend repository and install all dependencies using npm install.
4. Start the backend project using npm run watch, this will start up an API that listens on port 3030 for any queries.
5. Open up the frontend repository and install all dependencies using npm install.
6.  Run the project using npm start
7. Explore around
